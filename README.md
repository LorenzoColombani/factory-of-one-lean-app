## 📖 About

This interactive web application transforms the key Lean principles from Daniel Markovitz's book *"A Factory of One: Applying Lean Principles to Banish Waste and Improve Your Personal Performance"* into an engaging, visual learning experience.

The core premise: **You are a factory of one** — just like a factory, you process raw materials (information) to produce value for your customers. By applying Lean manufacturing principles to your personal workflow, you can dramatically improve efficiency and reduce waste.
